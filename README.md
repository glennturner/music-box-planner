Music Box Filmtinerary
================================

A Chrome extension for [Chicago's Music Box Theatre's website](http://musicboxtheatre.com) to add showtimes to your Google Calendar. It previously added support for seeing which theater a film was playing at, as well as tweaking the showtimes navigation, but a recent redesign has made those additions obsolete. (Yay!)

Why?
----

I love Chicago's Music Box Theatre. It's a gorgeous venue with a great staff, and I've been attending screenings there for more years than I'll publicly admit to. However, as they've added more festivals to their schedule, I've found myself wishing the website had a few more options to ease planning one's filmgoing itinerary. Consequently, this extension adds the following features to their website:

### Current Features

- Allows you to add a future showtime to your Google Calendar

### Future Features

- Add all screenings for a festival event to your Google Calendar

- Add a month picker to the schedule calendar

- Add support for 'Add to Calendar' links on the schedule calendar

- Allow support for 'Add to Calendar' links on -What's Playing- pages

### Prior Features

The redesign now includes these features, so they've been removed from the extension:

- Adds a link to showtimes to discern the room a film is screened in

- Adds a calendar picker to select showtime dates, as opposed to having to click through day-by-day

PLEASE NOTE: Apart from being a paying Music Box Member, I have no affiliation with the Music Box Theatre or Music Box Films.

Installation
------------

This extension is available to install directly via the Chrome Web Store, and requires no additional setup.
