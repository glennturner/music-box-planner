Music Box Filmtinerary
================================

A Chrome extension for [Chicago's Music Box Theatre's website](http://musicboxtheatre.com) to see which films are shown in which screening room, quickly pick a showtime calendar date, and add showtimes to your Google Calendar.

Why?
----

I love Chicago's Music Box Theatre. It's a gorgeous venue with a great staff, and I've been attending screenings there for more years than I'll publicly admit to. However, as they've added more festivals to their schedule, I've found myself wishing the website had a few more options to ease planning one's filmgoing itinerary. Consequently, this extension adds the following features to their website:

- Adds a link to showtimes to discern the room a film is screened in

- Adds a calendar picker to select showtime dates, as opposed to having to click through day-by-day

- Allows you to add a future showtime to your Google Calendar

PLEASE NOTE: Apart from being a paying Music Box Member, I have no affiliation with the Music Box Theatre or Music Box Films.

Installation
------------

This extension is available to install directly via the Chrome Web Store, and requires no additional setup.
