Music Box Planner
================================

A Chrome extension for [Chicago's Music Box Website](http://musicboxtheatre.com) to see which films are shown in which screening room, and allows for quickly picking a calendar date.

Why?
----

I love Chicago's Music Box Theater. I've been attending screenings there for more years than I'll admit to. However, there's been one consistent issue with their website: it's always been difficult to figure out whether a film was playing in the main screening room, or the side screening room.

Additionally, since they've started hosting more festivals (such as the Chicago Critics Film Fest and Cinepocalypse) it's been cumbersome to use their site to schedule a festival itinerary.

This plugin is meant for hardcore Music Box filmgoers and, hopefully, their web developers will integrate these features into their website in the future.

Installation
------------

This extension is available via the Chrome Web Store.

Future Features
----------------

- Personal festival scheduling, so you can click to add events to your personal fest calendar and share the calendar with others.
